KEY INSIGHT: MeltingPoint model depends on Compound model!

PROBLEM: Setting element.models = [MeltingPoint, Apparatus] still extracts compounds
because MeltingPoint.flatten() includes Compound as a dependency.

SOLUTION: For pre-abstract elements, only use models that don't depend on Compound:
- ‚úÖ Apparatus (no dependencies)
- ‚ùå MeltingPoint (depends on Compound)
- ‚ùå Compound (obviously)
