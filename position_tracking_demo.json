This novel methodology facilitates the coupling of methyl ketones with 2 - methyl - 3 - arylquinazolin -4 ( 3H ) - ones under mild conditions , delivering high selectivity and excellent yields . The reaction offers a significant advancement in constructing highly conjugated systems , providing a streamlined and sustainable alternative to traditional synthetic approaches . Beyond the innovative chemistry , the synthesized compounds demonstrated agonistic activity for TLX , an orphan nuclear receptor crucial for neural stem cell proliferation , development , and disease . These findings highlight the dual importance of the methodology in enabling sustainable synthesis and the biological relevance of the resulting compounds as potential therapeutic tools . Introduction Quinazolinones are bicyclic nitrogen - containing heterocyclic compounds characterized by a fused pyrimidine ring system at the 4 ′ and 8 ′ positions of the benzene ring . These compounds have attracted considerable attention in organic and medicinal chemistry due to their broad spectrum of pharmacological activities.1 – 5 Quinazolinone heterocycles play a crucial role in various biological processes and have been widely recognized for their therapeutic potential , demonstrating antihypertensive , antimicrobial , anti - hyperlipidemic , anti - inflammatory , and anti - convulsant activities.6,7 Furthermore , several quinazolinone derivatives have been investigated for their antitumor chemotherapeutic properties.8,9 Natural quinazolinone - based compounds exhibit remarkable physiological activities . For instance , rutaecarpine ( 1 ) , a natural alkaloid , has been found to inhibit cyclooxygenase -2 ( COX -2 ) , thereby exerting anti - inflammatory effects.10 – 12 Similarly , luotonin A ( 2 ) , another quinazolinone - containing alkaloid , has demonstrated cytotoxic activity against the murine leukemia P338 cell line.13,14 The β - indoloquinazolinone alkaloid bouchardatine ( 3 ) has been identified as a potential adipogenesis inhibitor , highlighting its role in metabolic regulation.15 Moreover , the quinazolinone - based drug idelalisib ( 4 ) has been approved for the treatment of chronic lymphocytic leukemia ( CLL ).16 – 18 Additionally , norquinadoline A ( 5 ) exhibits antiviral activity and cloroqualone ( 6 ) act as antitussive , further emphasizing the therapeutic significance of quinazolinone derivatives in drug discovery and development.19 In addition to these promising compounds , a diverse array of natural and synthetic quinazolinone derivatives has demonstrated a wide range of biological activities , including anticonvulsant , antidiabetic , sedative , and analgesic properties . These multifaceted pharmacological effects further underscore the therapeutic versatility of quinazolinone - based compounds . Fig . 1 highlights some notable examples of quinazolinone derivatives with significant medicinal potential.1 Quinazolin -4 ( 3H ) - one derivatives constitute a privileged class of nitrogen - containing heterocycles , known for their diverse pharmacological profiles . Among these , 2 - methyl - 3 - arylquinazolin -4 ( 3H ) - ones have garnered considerable attention due to the synthetic versatility conferred by the reactive C -2 methyl group and the electronic tunability of the C -3 aryl moiety . These scaffolds serve as valuable intermediates in the synthesis of structurally complex and biologically\n\n... [TRUNCATED - full length: 71585 chars]",
